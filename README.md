# Reproducible-Research-Assignment-1

This assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the day. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012 and include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day.

The data for this assignment has been uploaded to this repository, "Activity.csv".

    Description of the Dataset: Activity monitoring data [52K], stored in a CSV file with 17,568 observations.

The variables included in this dataset are:

    Steps: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing values are coded as NA\color{red}{\verb|NA|}NA)
    Date: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD format
    Interval: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which measurement was taken

This Repository contains all of the following commits:

    Code for reading in the dataset and/or processing the data
    Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
    Mean and median number of steps taken each day
    Time series plot of the average number of steps taken
    The 5-minute interval that, on average, contains the maximum number of steps
    Code to describe and show a strategy for imputing missing data
    Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day after missing values are imputed
    Panel plot comparing the average number of steps taken per 5-minute interval across weekdays and weekends
    All of the R code needed to reproduce the results (numbers, plots, etc.) in the report
